            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the
                fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few months earlier had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish
                physician and social and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because
                she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the
                necessary funds.She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again.
            </p>
            <p>In December 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri
                Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered
                by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."</p>

            <p>
                The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth
                and twenty-first centuries. Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:
            <blockquote>
                The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not
                be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a
                reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium
                provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the
                structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom
                was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer
                could be successfully attacked.
